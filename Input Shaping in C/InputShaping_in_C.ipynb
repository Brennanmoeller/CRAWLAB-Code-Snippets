    "This notebook demonstrates a *very* basic implementation of input shaping in C, using the [Minimal C kernel for Jupyter](https://github.com/brendan-rius/jupyter-c-kernel). That kernal needs to be installed following the instructions on the project GitHub page.\n",

So, here the code to generate the shapers, the `create_Shaper()` family of functions, and implement input shaping, the `doInputShaping()` function, are included alongside the `main()` function."
